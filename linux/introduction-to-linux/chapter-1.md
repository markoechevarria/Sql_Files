## Chapter 1. What is Linux?

# 1.1 History
About 30 years ago, there was one problem: every computer had a different operating system.
Software was always customized to serve a specific purpose and ssoftware for a specific purpose didn't run on another system.

In 1969, a group of developers started to working in UNIX, which was written in C and was able to recycle code

UNIX needed only a small piece of code to develop one system.
Kernel is the only piece of code that need to be adapted for every system and forms the base of the UNIX system.
The operating system and all other function were built around this kernel and written in C (developed specially for creating the UNIX system), 

# 1.2. Linus and LInux

By the beginning of the 90s, Linus Torvalds, a young man studying computer science at the university of Helsinski, started to create a free available version of UNIX.
